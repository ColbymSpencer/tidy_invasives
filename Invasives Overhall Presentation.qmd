## Current System

Survey -> Treat

- Contractors, park staff, volunteers, and americorps survey 'infestations'
- Return to treat with appropriate herbicide

NRTS

- point data only
- 

## infestations

- canopy levels may differ
- treatments may differ

## Drawbacks

People treating an infestation have to eyeball infestation boundary when revisiting

- contractors
- OPS staff and Americorps

Ambiguous infestation composition

- does composition change after treatment
- affects herbicide requirements for effective treatment
-   


## New System

Monitor with areas not points

- can see growth / shrinkage of infestation
- Monitor by species population, not 'infestation'
